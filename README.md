# Calypsan_Space_Shooter
# A basic space shooter modeled loosely off of Galaga as a personal project to better understand the capabilities of Pygame. 
# Coded in Python. 
# A .exe file has been added that can be launched, provided that the .wav and .mp3 files are in the same folder, and the .png files are in a subfolder 
# called "assets".
