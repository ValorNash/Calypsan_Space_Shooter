# Escape From Calypsan
# A basic space shooter modeled loosely off of Galaga as a personal project to better understand the capabilities of Pygame. 
# Coded in Python. 
# The game can be run either through the .py file, or by downloading the "Escape From Calypsan" folder and running the .exe. 
# The "Escape.exe" must be in the Escape from Calypsan folder, and that folder must contain Song1-6 .wav's, the Exit Calypsan.MP3, and the assets subfolder containing the games .png files.
